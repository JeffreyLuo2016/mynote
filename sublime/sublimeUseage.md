Regarding the bugIt looks like this is a known bug of the Package Control since 23rd of September.That also appears only to OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) users.I guess this will be solved with an update. While this is a known bug and the cause is due to certification of the KeyChain there is no reason to worry about.For more information about the bug and to keep yourself up-to-date have a look here.The current status of the bug is still open.How to temporarly fix the problemHere is how to overcome the problem temporarily until the bug is fixed:Open Keychain Access from your applications, (Ensure that the lock on the top-left is unlocked, by entering your password).Then choose login from the Keychains list on your left.In the search bar on the top-right, enter the keyword that is located in your error message next to Cert 0:, which in your case is: Kaspersky Web Anti-Virus Certification AuthorityYou will probably then (don't consider the above screenshot, in your case, you will have results) have the expected result underneath the table.Right-click and delete the certificate. (You will probably prompt to enter your password)Verify if the process was succesful by running the following command in your Terminal.app: /usr/bin/security dump-trust-settings -dIf the following message is shown as a result from the previous command in the Terminal: SecTrustSettingsCopyCertificates: No Trust Settings were found. then everything was successful, otherwise try again the process until you get this message.Credits for the above temporary fix here, and thanks to Diego Plentz user bellow for pointing out the tutorial reference as well.
